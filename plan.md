# D2 Theorycraft — Project Plan

> **To resume in a new session:** say `Claude, continue with plan.md`  
> Claude will read this file first, check the current state of any referenced files, and pick up exactly where the last session ended.

---

## How Claude Should Use This File

1. **At session start** — read `plan.md` before doing anything else. Verify the current state of files matches what is recorded here (things may have changed since the last update).
2. **During the session** — work through the "Next Actions" section in order.
3. **At session end** — update this file: tick completed checklist items, revise progress percentages, rewrite "Next Actions" to reflect what is actually next, and note anything discovered or deferred.
4. **Never skip the end-of-session update.** This file is the only persistent record of what was done and what comes next.

---

## General Work Plan

**Project:** D2 Theorycraft — `www.d2theorycraft.com`  
**Repo:** `https://github.com/berri10010/d2-theorycraft`  
**Stack:** Next.js static export → GitHub → Cloudflare Worker (static assets via `env.ASSETS.fetch`). No SSR, no API routes. Builds run on GitHub Actions; deploys triggered by push to `main`.  
**Workspace (local):** `C:\Users\husse\Documents\d2-theorycraft`

The site is a Destiny 2 weapon theorycrafting tool. Users can browse weapon perks, simulate god rolls, and inspect damage/TTK calculations. The ongoing work has three tracks:

1. **Perk Audit** — verify and correct the stat/activation data for all 415 weapon perks in `src/data/perkAudit.json` using the live Clarity community database as ground truth.
2. **UI Enhancements** — surface the corrected perk data in the EffectsPanel and other components (TTA badges, stat modifier display, comparison grid).
3. **Weapon System Module** — a standalone TypeScript architecture (`weapon-system/`) implementing a component-based heterogeneous stat system. Built and committed; integration into the main site is pending.

| `src/lib/plDelta.ts` — `getPlDeltaMultiplier(delta)` + `fmtPlDelta(delta)` helpers | ✅ Done |
| `src/lib/damageMath.ts` — replace global `PVE_DAMAGE_SCALAR = 3.0` with `getCombatantScalar(itemSubType, tier)`; expand `PVE_HEALTH_TIERS` from 3 tiers (Minor/Major/Champion) to 5 (add Miniboss 2500 HP, Boss 4000 HP); change `calculateTTK` / `calculateTTKCurve` API to accept `enemyTier: string` instead of `enemyHealth: number` | ✅ Done |
| Update all call sites: `TTKPanel`, `TTKAndFalloffPanel`, `ComparisonGrid`, `editor/page.tsx` | ✅ Done |
| `TTKAndFalloffPanel` — PL delta slider (−30 to +10, presets −20/−10/−5/0/+5/+10, colour-coded label); `effectiveMultiplier = multiplier × plMult` flows into TTK, breakpoint sparkline, and falloff chart Y-axis | ✅ Done |
| `TTKPanel` — same PL delta slider added to PvE section | ✅ Done |

**Stage 11 progress: 100%**

## Checklist (Quick Reference)

### Ongoing
- [ ] Run `python3 build_perk_audit_json.py` after any override additions to `perkAudit.json`
- [ ] Push: `git push` — GitHub Actions handles build + deploy automatically

---

## Known Issues (deferred)

| Issue | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| DPS panel magazine size is wrong | `calcStats['Magazine']` is a 0–100 investmentStat, not round count. oracle_engine uses a per-archetype quadratic formula (same evpp/vpp/offset pattern as reload) to convert it to actual rounds. DPS panel currently uses raw stat value. |
| LFR charge-time damage penalty not modelled | oracle_engine applies a proportional damage penalty when perks reduce charge time below base on LFRs: `dmg *= 1.0 - (0.6 * delta) / base_damage`. We don't apply this. |

---

## Next Actions

> These are ordered by priority. Claude should start from the top.

Stage 12 is the active work. 12A (partial), 12B (partial), 12C, 12D, 12E, 12F, 12G, and 12H are complete. Remaining priorities:

1. **12A remaining** — Damage vs Distance chart; flinch resistance; per-activity PvE scaling dropdown
2. **12B remaining** — Screenshot mode (Destiny-style weapon card renderer for social sharing)

---

*Last updated: 2026-04-13 — Session summary:*

*1. Parser fix (commit 9e60175): Exotic weapons with choosable mods (e.g. Praxic Blade Tang/Grip) now show all options. Root cause: Bungie sets currentlyCanRoll:false on non-default alternatives in reusablePlugSetHash; old code filtered them out. Fix splits plug set handling by type — reusablePlugSetHash always includes all items, randomizedPlugSetHash keeps the currentlyCanRoll filter.*

*2. Build cache fix (commit 5a0e45a): Added DATA_FORMAT_VERSION to manifest cache key so parser logic changes force a full re-parse even when the Bungie manifest version is unchanged. Bumped to '2' to pick up the reusablePlugSet fix.*

*3. Weapon Perks redesign (commit b907927): RollEditor now splits perk columns into two zones — "Fixed Traits" (single-option columns shown as inline rows with icon + name + stat mods + description) and "Choosable Mods" (multi-option columns shown as the existing icon-grid selector). Zone headers only appear when both zones are present. Store auto-selects single-option perks on weapon load so their stat modifiers always apply without user interaction.*

*4. Intrinsic trait moved (commit c4a5971): Removed intrinsic perk from RollEditor Fixed Traits zone. WeaponHeader now loads the intrinsic description from Compendium via useCompendiumPerks (previously blank because build pipeline strips manifest text).*

*5. External Buffs UX (commits cf460d8, be1dc4a): Empowering and Debuffs sections are now collapsible accordions with chevron headers, active count badge visible when collapsed. Broken Bungie CDN icons removed. Both sections start collapsed by default.*

*Last updated: 2026-04-19 — Stage 12 batch completions:*

*Batch 3 (commit db6cee4): Weapons Stat slider debounce (onPointerUp pattern with local state so charts only update on release); PvP slider min changed 100→0 with "0" preset added; description text corrected to "0–100"/"100–200"; Weapon Surge moved from MasterworkPanel into ArmorModPanel.*

*Batch 4 (commit df5bbec): AmmoPanel now reads ammoType, Magazine stat, and Ammo Capacity (reserves) from Bungie manifest first — MossyMax static data only for mag round count and reserve mod tiers. RollEditor single-option columns show Clarity description + stat mods inline beside the icon.*

*Batch 5 (commit ef8f16f): All perk columns (barrel/mag/perk/origin) unified into one scrollable grid — no more Fixed Traits zone. EffectsPanel guard removed (now available for all weapons). External buffs now apply flat stat bonuses to weapon stat bars via new `statBonuses` field in DamageBuff interface and buffs.json (Amplified +40 Handling/+20 AE, Spark of Frequency +40 Reload, Flow State +40 Reload/+20 Handling, Thread of Ascent +30 AE/+30 Reload, Heat Rises +30 AE, Rally Barricade +50 Reload). Recoil Direction chart redesigned as DIM-style white pie sector (ones digit → directional tilt, overall value → cone tightness).*

---

*Last updated: 2026-04-20 — Session summary:*

*1. RecoilChart formula fix: corrected arc direction so recoil 60→right, 50→left, 55→center (was inverted — changed `90 +` to `90 −`). Also removed erroneous `× 0.45` scaling factor. Final formula: `centerAngle = 90 − sin((x+5)·2π/20)·(100−x)`, `arcWidth = ((100−x)/100)·180`.*

*2. Unified perk column layout: removed all single-option column special-casing in RollEditor.tsx that caused inline text to bleed behind adjacent icons. All columns now use identical layout (`flex-col`, `items-center`, `min-w-[60px]`). Single-option perks auto-selected on weapon load.*

*3. Portal-based Tooltip component (`src/components/ui/Tooltip.tsx`): escapes overflow-hidden parents via `createPortal` to `document.body` with `position: fixed` + `getBoundingClientRect()`. 220 ms show delay, instant hide, flips above/below based on trigger y-position. Wrapped around all perk icons in RollEditor.*

*4. Intrinsic stat modifier pills in WeaponHeader: intrinsic trait card now shows green/red stat mod pills (e.g. "+5 Handling"). Description resolved via 4-source cascade: manifest → Clarity DB (by hash) → compendium (filtered, colon-terminated entries rejected) → FRAME_FALLBACK hardcoded map (20 common archetypes). Fixes blank descriptions for exotic intrinsics, Rapid-Fire Frame, Adaptive Frame, and others.*

*5. Exotic armor selector (12D complete): `src/data/exoticArmor.ts` with 10 Hunter / 12 Warlock / 10 Titan exotics, each with `statBonuses` and optional `weaponTypeStatBonuses` (e.g. Lucky Pants +100 Handling for Hand Cannons). BuffToggle.tsx gains ExoticArmorSection per class — `<select>` dropdown + stat pills (green when active weapon type matches, grey otherwise). `useWeaponStore` extended with `activeExoticArmor` state and `setExoticArmor` action; `getCalculatedStats` applies exotic bonuses after buff bonuses, clamped 0–100.*

*6. wrangler.toml observability sync: added full `[observability]`, `[observability.logs]`, and `[observability.traces]` sections to match Cloudflare dashboard configuration.*

---

*Last updated: 2026-04-23 — Session summary (filter panel):*

*Search filter panel rework (commit 1701572): FilterDrawer replaced with a category-button panel. Clicking a category (Weapon Type, Frame, Trait, Energy, Ammo, Slot, Rarity, Perk, Column 1–5, Source, Season, Foundry) expands a searchable options list with 3-state inc/exc picking. Column 1–5 is nested — shows Barrel/Magazine/Perk 1/Perk 2/Origin sub-categories. Toggles row (Featured, Craftable, Adept, Sunset) at top of panel. Foundry field added end-to-end: BungieInventoryItem.traitIds, parser extractFoundry(), Weapon.foundry. DATA_FORMAT_VERSION bumped 12→13 to force re-parse.*

---

*Last updated: 2026-04-23 — Session summary (animations, PWA, collapsible panels):*

*1. Clarity descriptions on perk hover in RollEditor (commit b2a961d): `renderClarityDesc` and `CLASS_COLOURS` extracted to `src/lib/clarityRender.tsx` shared module. RollEditor now calls `useClarityPerks()` and shows Clarity community text in the perk tooltip; falls back to manifest description when no Clarity entry exists.*

*2. PWA + mobile (commit ad3129d, d0ff23f): Added `manifest.json`, `public/sw.js` (cache-first for `/_next/static/` hashed assets, network-first for HTML), `ServiceWorkerRegistration` client component wired into `layout.tsx`, `Viewport` export (device-width, themeColor), `appleWebApp` metadata. App icons: triple-chevron SVG + 192px/512px PNGs. Sidebar drawer width changed to `w-[85vw] max-w-72` for small phones.*

*3. Animations (commit eb4e7b3): (a) Stat bar numbers count up smoothly on weapon load via `useAnimatedValue` hook (cubic ease-out, 250 ms). (b) Perk selection ring burst: `@keyframes perkRing` box-shadow expand+fade (380 ms) renders as sibling span on click. (c) Weapon panel fade-in: `key={activeWeapon.hash}` forces remount → `@keyframes weaponFadeIn` plays (220 ms). (d) Sidebar weapon list left-border hover accent: `border-l-2 border-transparent` → `hover:border-white/15` / active `border-amber-500/50`.*

*4. Collapsible panels (commit d1c394d): `CollapsiblePanel` shared component (`src/components/ui/CollapsiblePanel.tsx`) — card background, toggle header, `stopPropagation` on `headerRight` slot. All panels (StatDisplay, RollEditor, EffectsPanel, GodRollPanel, WishlistPanel, SimilarWeaponsPanel, BuffToggle) converted. External Buffs, Similar Weapons, and Wishlists start collapsed by default.*

*5. Service worker cache fix (commits 533a628, 21ae818): Homepage was unstyled after deploys because sw.js pre-cached `'/'` HTML; after Next.js rotated CSS filenames the stale HTML referenced missing stylesheets. Fix: removed HTML pre-caching, bumped cache to `d2tc-v2`. Also removed non-existent `weapons-2.json` fetch from homepage `Promise.all`.*

*6. WeaponDataPanel grey sub-panels fix (commit acc8883): Wrapping WeaponDataPanel in CollapsiblePanel caused `bg-white/5` double-stacking (panel card + sub-panel card). Fixed by replacing CollapsiblePanel with inline collapse logic (plain `<button>` + toggle state, no card background), so sub-panels render directly on the black background.*

*Last updated: 2026-04-22 — Session summary:*

*1. MW whitelist system (parser.ts, commits in this session): added `MW_WHITELIST_BY_TYPE` constant and `getMwWhitelist()` function. Blocks cross-type stat bleed — e.g. Sword `Impact` MW showing on Auto Rifles and Bows. Handles frame-level overrides: Micro-Missile, Balanced/Dynamic Heat Weapon, High-Impact Combat Bow.*

*2. Draw Time / Charge Time fixes (parser.ts): bow "Charge Time" masterwork option renamed → "Draw Time"; positive bonuses on both Draw Time and Charge Time are negated at parse time (lower raw value = better, so +10 from Bungie → -10 displayed). Both `'Micro-Missile'` and `'Micro-Missile Frame'` intrinsic names now accepted.*

*3. Grenade Launcher stat display fix (weaponStatMappings.ts): renamed key from `'Special/Heavy Grenade Launcher'` → `'Grenade Launcher'` to match the actual `itemTypeDisplayName` in Bungie's manifest. GL weapon stats were completely blank before this fix.*

*4. Sword stat display fixes (StatDisplay.tsx): added `'Ammo Capacity'` to `ALL_BAR_STAT_KEYS` so sword reserve bar renders. Added `ALWAYS_SHOW_STATS = new Set(['Guard Resistance', 'Guard Endurance'])` so guard stats show even at 0 (Legacy/Vortex frames have no guard by design).*

*5. Season 27+ tiered masterwork secondary bonus (useWeaponStore.ts + MasterworkPanel.tsx): weapons from season 27 onward always get a flat +5 secondary bonus — the old +2/+3/+4 adept/crafted/enhanced ladder only applies to pre-s27 weapons. MasterworkPanel label logic rewritten to compute the correct total from `isTiered` + role flags.*

*Known issue resolved this session: Handling breakdown (Ready/ADS/Stow) wired up via oracle_engine linear formulas; Draw Time / Charge Time math no longer deferred.*

---

*Last updated: 2026-04-23 — Session summary (oracle_engine stat breakdowns + DPS panel):*

*1. `src/lib/reloadTimes.ts` (new): quadratic reload time formulas for 16 weapon types from d2foundry/oracle_engine. Grenade Launchers split by ammo type (special vs heavy). `NORMALIZE` map handles Bungie display name variants.*

*2. `src/lib/handlingTimes.ts` (new, from previous session): linear Ready/ADS/Stow formulas for 16 weapon types. `HandlingBreakdown` component shows three amber ms values below the Handling stat bar.*

*3. `src/lib/bowDrawWindow.ts` (new): bow perfect-draw-start formula from oracle_engine subFamilies 905/906. Precision Frame → `0.003×stability + 0.5s`; all other bow frames → `stability/400 + 0.3s`. Result shown as "Perfect X.XXs" below the Draw Time bar.*

*4. `src/lib/dpsCalc.ts` (new): DPS calculation using weaponStats timing data. Handles standard, burst (Pulse Rifle, burst Sidearm), and charge (Fusion, LFR, Bow) weapon categories. Returns optimalDps (continuous fire, all-crit) and sustainedDps (mag + reload cycle, all-crit) for both PvP and PvE (3× Major/Elite scalar). Also computes derived RPM from shot timing.*

*5. `src/components/weapon/DpsPanel.tsx` (new): DPS panel tab in WeaponDataPanel. Shows body/crit/burst chips, Optimal DPS and Sustained DPS rows with PvP and PvE columns, and RPM/Mag/Reload chips. Shows "no data" gracefully for archetypes without timing entries.*

*6. `src/components/weapon/StatDisplay.tsx` updated: `ReloadBreakdown` component shows reload time in seconds below Reload bar. `DrawWindowBreakdown` component shows perfect draw start time below Draw Time bar (bows only, gated on `itemSubType === 31`).*

*7. Share button (from previous session, commits da71feb + b5c5903): replaced single Share button with dropdown offering "Roll Permalink" and "DIM Wishlist Item". DIM format uses `&perks=` separator. Perk sort order matches DIM: non-origin perks descending by socket index, origin trait last.*

---

*Last updated: 2026-04-24 — Session summary (stat hover tooltips + compare tab timing chips):*

*1. Removed AE "flinch" annotation — Airborne Effectiveness does not measure flinch resistance.*

*2. All derived stat values moved to hover tooltips (80ms delay, via existing portal Tooltip component): Handling (Ready/ADS/Stow ms), Reload (X.XXs), Charge Time (X.XXs), Draw Time (Perfect X.XXs for bows), Range (Hip Xm in cyan + ADS Xm in amber-300), Zoom (magnification X.X×). StatBarRow `details` prop and CompactStatCard `annotation` prop removed. Stat bars and compact cards are now clean by default.*

*3. ComparisonGrid new chip rows (commits d69b437, 1cb0999, 7833f63): after TTK/Hip/ADS row, added Ready/ADS/Stow handling chips (slate-200, only shown when formula data exists for weapon type) and a dynamic Reload/Charge/Perfect timing row (amber, 1–2 chips depending on weapon type). Zoom magnification not added to compare tab per user request.*

*4. Charge Time tooltip added (X.XXs on hover over Charge Time bar) — Charge Time stat is stored as raw ms in Bungie manifest, so no formula needed, just divide by 1000.*

*5. oracle_engine research: investigated Magazine, Draw Time, and Charge Time stat math (see Known Issues and Reference sections below). Key findings: (a) `baseStats['Magazine']` is a 0–100 investmentStat, not round count — oracle_engine applies a per-archetype quadratic formula to convert it to actual rounds; our DPS panel currently uses the raw stat value which is incorrect. (b) Draw Time and Charge Time are also 0–100 investmentStats in oracle_engine's model; archetype-specific linear formulas convert stat deltas to seconds. Our display of the raw ms Bungie manifest value is correct for the stat bar but perk effects on these stats interact with the formula, not directly with ms. (c) One special case: Sniper Rifles with mag_stat > 90 receive +1 bonus round after the quadratic formula. (d) LFRs: perks that reduce charge time below base also apply a proportional damage penalty (`dmg *= 1.0 - 0.6 * delta / base_damage`), which we do not model.*

*Last updated: 2026-04-24 — Session summary (bug fix):*

*1. Weapon Surge dmg label floating-point fix (commit eb1c920, ArmorModPanel.tsx line 175): `(multiplier - 1) * 100` with no rounding produced `5.499999999999994%` due to IEEE 754 representation of `1.055`. Fixed with `.toFixed(2)` + unary `+` to strip trailing zeros → displays `+5.5% dmg`.*
